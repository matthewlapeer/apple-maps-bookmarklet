## Installation
As with all bookmarklets on iPhone, this will happen in multiple steps:
1. Bookmark this page
2. Update the Title to something you'll remember (like "Open in Apple Maps")
3. Navigate to [bookmarklet.txt](/bookmarklet.txt) and copy the text
4. Open your bookmarks, and edit the one you created
5. Save the text you copied from bookmarklet.txt in the second field (replacing the existing text)

## Motivation
iPhone users who do not use Google maps cannot easily share address info or open addresses in Apple Maps from Google search results.
When trying to copy an address, Google redirects to Google Maps. When trying to share and address, the link shared will direct the receiver to download Google Maps.

In order to end the hassel around getting the address info, this bookmarklet extracts the address from a Google search and allows the user to directly open it in Apple Maps. From there it can be shared, used for directions, or anything else the user would like to do with the address. They are no longer stuck in a "download Google Maps" loop.

## Limitations
This bookmarket does not work with Google results that display multiple matching addresses. If you have this situation, try to refine your search so Google knows the exact location you're searching.

This bookmarklet is intended for Safari on iPhone. It will not perform as expected with Safari on other devices.
